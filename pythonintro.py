    Python is an 
interpreted (means running code line by line), 
object-oriented (means this language is based on objects (such as data) rather than functions), 
high-level (means it's easy for humans to understand) programming language 
with dynamic semantics (means its variable are dynamic object, and they exist at run time level)
developed by GUIDO VAN ROSSUM in the year 1991
    Python is generally used to create web and mobile software, in artificial intelligence(AI) and 
machine learning(ML), to perform data manipulation and analysis, and much more.
    Python is popular because.
1.Python is open-source.
2.Python is simple and easy to learn.
3.Python is versatile.
4.Python is used a lot.
"""
a = 100
#here a(identifier) = 100(object/entity)
#Identifier is the name given to the object, which will act as a reference. Using this name one can recognize an object
"""
Rules to delcare an Identifier
1.a-z,A-Z are valid (Python is a case sensitive language a=!A)
2._(underscroll) is allowed
3.Space is not allowed in between
4.Special symbols & characters not allowed
5.a.Number as a prefix is not allowed
  b.Number as a suffix is allowed
6.Numbers are not a valid identifier
7.Numbers in between is allowed
8.Reserved keywords are not allowed
   How to check Reserve Keywords ?

Indentation in python
    In python, indentation is used to define blocks of code such as functions,loops & control structures.
The level of indentation determines the scope of the code block,and all statements within the same block must 
have the same level of indentation. The recommended indentation level is 4 spaces, although tabs can also be used.
Inconsistent or incorrect indentation can cause syntax errors in python.  
--------------------------------------------------------
Data types in Python
It contains 14 data types
  Numeric
1.int (0-9)
2.float (12.5 - floor.ceil)
3.complex (1+x - real+img)
  Boolean (if you're dealing with logical,comparison,identity,membership operators - Boolean Output)
4.True
5.False
6.String ' '
7.List [ ]
8.Tuple ( )
9.Set { }
10.Dictionary { }
11.Frozenset ( )
12.Range ( )
13.Bytes ( )
14.Bytearray ( )
   None
---------------------------------------------
Mutable & Immutable Datatypes in Python
Mutable - Values can be changed after they are created
1.List
2.Dictionary
3.Set
4.Bytes array
& Others are Immutable such as int,float,str,tuple
Immutable - Values cannot be changed after they are created
